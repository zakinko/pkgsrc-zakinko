$NetBSD$

Print elapsed time with a format that matches time_t.

time_t is 64 bits on NetBSD while long is 32 bits on the 32 bit ports, so
"%ld" is the wrong conversion and gcc says so:

  augtool.c:469:21: warning: format '%ld' expects argument of type 'long int',
  but argument 2 has type 'time_t {aka long long int}' [-Wformat=]

Cast rather than assume time_t is long long.  Still present upstream, with
no issue or pull request open about it; OpenBSD carries the same fix.
