# mozc can be built either with bazel, which is what upstream tests, or with
# gyp, which upstream keeps in maintenance mode.  The gyp build needs neither
# bazel nor a JDK, but upstream has dropped the ibus client and the GTK
# candidate window from it, so only inputmethod/mozc-server and
# inputmethod/mozc-elisp include this file.
#
# bazel can be used on two platforms and no others.  devel/bazel wants a
# JVM -- PKG_JVMS_ACCEPTED= openjdk11 -- and mk/java-vm.mk names where that
# exists:
#
#	_ONLY_FOR_PLATFORMS.openjdk11= x86_64 i386 aarch64 earmv[67]hf
#
# so powerpc64, riscv64, mips64, sparc64, alpha and ia64 have no JVM at all,
# and of the four that do, i386 and earmv[67]hf are 32-bit, where bazel does
# not build.  That leaves x86_64 and aarch64.
#
# devel/bazel means to say the 32-bit half itself, with
# BROKEN_ON_PLATFORM= ${LP32PLATFORMS}, but a second assignment further down
# overwrites that line and nothing currently stops a 32-bit build from being
# attempted.  Reported separately.
#
# Test for the two that work rather than listing the many that do not, so a
# platform added later defaults to the build that has a chance of running.

# The option is acted on in Makefile.common rather than here, because

# share that file without including this one, and they have no gyp build to
# choose.  Keeping the .if there lets them take the bazel branch unchanged.
