$NetBSD$

Add the /usr/local paths, which are missing from three filters.

On the BSDs rsyslog is configured under /usr/local/etc, as software the
system did not ship itself.  Dovecot, Nginx, Php, Postfix, Puppet,
Sudoers and Systemd already carry their /usr/local counterpart; Rsyslog
does not.

Sent upstream as hercules-team/augeas#888; this is that diff.
